Where are you going?

 I'm going on a trip in my favorite rocket ship drifting through the sky with a magnified eye.

 Now what I'm looking for with this magnified eye are SWE opportunities that place me in a fun, 
collaborative, and ambitious work environment. While contributing to high impact projects, I want to 
constantly learn more and better my craft. I want to do this alongside supportive and driven people 
who share the same passions as me and push me to new limits.
