What is possible?

 I don't have to know what is possible to know that there is so much outside of my knowledge that is 
possible. I'm excited to continuously unravel this question for the exact moments where my mind and 
imagination broadens, those ah-ha moments. As a Black woman who constantly faces opposition to my 
imagination, I am enthralled to see how it flourishes nonetheless as I meet and interact with others 
who are intentional about the exercise of their imagination.

 So what is possible? My answer, as abstract as the question, is the unknown.
