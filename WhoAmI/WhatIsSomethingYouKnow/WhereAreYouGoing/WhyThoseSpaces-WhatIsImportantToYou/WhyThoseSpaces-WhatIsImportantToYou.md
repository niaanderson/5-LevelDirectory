Why those spaces? What is important to you?

 I'm interested in bridging technology, business, and social impact. Businesses and technology can 
address inequalities faced by low-income and minority communities. However, businesses and 
technology can also be used to augment these inequalities.

 In ambitious work environments where Iâ€™m utilizing my curiosity, imagination and analytical thinking 
alongside people who share the same passions as me, I'll get to be on the side of history that uses 
technology to advance low-income and minority communities.

 Those are the same communities that set trends in the markets that influence how other audiences 
react to a product. They also make up a considerable amount of users. Taking on the role of a 
dedicated advocate is important to me and should be important to businesses as well.
