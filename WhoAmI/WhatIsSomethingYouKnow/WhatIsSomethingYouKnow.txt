What is something you know?

Besides knowing I am the sum of everything I've experienced, I also know my knowledge is endless 
with access to search engines like google, youtube, tik-tok, and community/my network. Through 
software engineering, we've expanded what's possible for individual and collective knowledge.

Hey Alexia? 
Mm-hmm?
How much knowledge can a personâ€™s brain hold?
