Who am I?

 Maya Angelou once said, “You are the sum total of everything you've ever seen, heard, eaten, 
smelled, been told, forgot - it's all there.” 

 Being surrounded by the very definition of “it takes a village” has ingrained in me from the 
beginning a passion to continue through action the embodiment of that proverb. I want to pay forward 
all the time, support and guidance poured into me directly or indirectly by family, teachers, 
coaches, friends, neighbors, musicians, storytellers, and those silenced by the world but with 
dreams of a better future, pass their voice on through me. 

 In a village, each person has their own role. Despite roles being different, each one is 
instrumental in success. I see my role in society being a software engineer where I work on 
high-impact projects and can utilize, daily, my curiosity, imagination, and analytical thinking. 
Looking at the timeline of me, this vision of who I am, and want to become makes sense.

 What have you digested in your lifetime? What are you choosing to digest? What's consistent and 
what has changed? Ooo, what has been an acquired taste that you now love? And overall what story 
does ‘your diet’ tell?
